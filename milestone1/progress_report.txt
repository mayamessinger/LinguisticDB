* description of application
	* LingusticDB will be a tool for comparing books in the Project Gutenberg library. Extracting metrics like sentence length, word count, and title similarities, it will suggest similar books and authors to a book or author queried. Also will try to analyze similarities between "bestselling" books to determine what writing styles are popular.
* getting data
