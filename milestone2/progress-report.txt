We have created a database with our Books, Authors, Writes, BookWordAggregates, and Users tables, including the processing required to refine the texts and use them to populate the database as well as the front end to query the database. Other tables we have created but have not populated yet can be seen in our E/R diagram.
Our E/R diagram has changed a lot, and can be viewed in an attached document. We have expanded our framework, fleshing out additional tables and metrics. Importantly, we added a Users table to allow users of our database to add ratings and reviews. This adds a more involved UI to our application. Additionally, our similarity metrics between authors and between books have been expanded, and using cosine similarity to do this will serve as a key advantage over other databases. Finally, we will add some analysis on parts of speech
We still have to fully integrate our more complex metrics with the application. Front-end is very basic but has a strong and successful connection between a database on a VM, a backend server on a VM (to handle front-end requests and query the database), and an interactive front-end. We will continue to improve our front-end and possibly add other metrics. We will define further queries.
