=== SINCE MILESTONE 2 ===
Maya:
* From the HTML and CSS files Alex made, converted everything directly to Vue.js templates
* Wrote all of the JavaScript, to create front-end website with interaction that pulled all information from the database
	* client methods (using Ajax HTTP POST requests) to call server, server methods to query/update database, handle returned data, format/parse for display in front-end
	* implemented user features - creating account, signing in, changing password, rating/reviewing books, and connected to database
* Wrote server to handle front-end requests, query and update database (npm module pg), and return db information to front-end. Alex wrote many queries and I added some

Alex:
* Completed the HTML/CSS part of the website
* Designed the website logo
* Wrote the SQL queries for the "Advanced Search" feature and "Statistics" page
* Implemented 9 additional indexes to improve the performance of the "Advanced Search" feature
* Updated the E/R diagram

John:

Ryan:
* Wrote and successfully ran Python script to generate the data for the Sequences relation in the database (required creating complex data structure that would store the book that the sequence applied to, a word, a word that followed this word, and how many times the word followed this word)
* Wrote and successfully Python script to generate the data for the CommonWords relation in the database (required counting the instances of each word in a Project Gutenberg book and then selectively filtering the results in order to make them meaningful)
* Updated load.sql file in the database in order to be able to load the data for the aforementioned 2 relations of the table
* Made the decision that the parts-of-speech analysis that could feasibly be performed and displayed in the database would not display enough useful or relevant information to truly be included within the database
